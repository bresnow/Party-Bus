## ACT I 
    
    a. Opening scene will establish the inside of a luxury party bus and introduce the seven main characters and the unassuming bus driver. Booze, drugs and other dirty fun stuff. Character introductions, environment, and general vibe of the movie will be established with 
    
    1. violet, yellow-green, and off white color palate
    1. contrasting background and foreground movement.
    1. damn good music

    b. By the end of the first act each character is supposed to subtlety represent the seven [capital vices](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_deadly_sins) and have the related consequences either already occur or cleverly set in motion.

### *The Characters*

1. #### PRIDE
    - Accomplished, upper middle class white male
    - On the surface appears content and appreciative of his friends and life choices 
    - Facade gradually begins to slip to reveal an inflated ego, entitlement and arrogance 
    - Condescending when threatened due to imposter syndrome 
    - Bipolar
    - Serial second degree murderer
    - 4th to die

1. #### GREED
    - Ambitious, sexy, upper class ethnic woman
    - 
 

### What

- The driver cryptically references each character's sins before a punishment transitioning into a character's flashback and how they made it to the bus. 
- After a character dies they come back to life as their "true soul". No inhibitions. Zombie-esque true representation of the sin each character represents.


### Why

- Twist reveals that each of them died in each other's flashback implying they never knew each other.
- The Driver is essentially "the rowman" that takes souls to the underworld.
